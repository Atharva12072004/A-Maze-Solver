# A* Maze Solver
This project is a Python-based A* Maze Solver that visualizes how the A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm finds the shortest path in a grid-based maze. It allows users to interactively set the start point, end point, and walls on the grid. The algorithm uses heuristics like Manhattan or Euclidean distance to efficiently find the optimal path.
